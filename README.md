# UiPath
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is the use of software with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) capabilities to handle high-volume, repeated tasks that previously required humans to perform. Some of these tasks could be addressing queries, making complex calculations, maintenance of records, and making high volume transactions.

Since RPA is a technology, it requires a medium to execute its objectives. There are several tools in the market that help create bots. One such popular tool is UiPath.

UiPath is an advanced RPA tool that enables you to design automation processes visually, through diagrams. UiPath provides complete end-to-end automation, calling it “hyperautomation”
Here are some of the advantages of UiPath -

Activity library- UiPath has an extensive activity library with pre-built drag and drop actions
Security - UiPath offers high-level security since we can store and encrypt the credentials on a centralized server
Recording - UiPath has recorders for desktop apps and emulators for quick creation of automation
Third-party integration - We can plug in various technologies from IBM Watson & Google
Powerful Debugging - UiPath offers intuitive and flexible debugging options
UiPath also offers three products -

UiPath Studio- It is a platform to create automation bots. It encompasses hundreds of activity templates and readymade components to drag and drop
UiPath Robot - They run the automation that is created using UiPath studio
UiPath Orchestrator - It is a centralized robot management dashboard where you can easily deploy, secure, and manage your UiPath Robots at scale

Client layer - The Client Layer consists of the UiPath Studio and the UiPath Robot. The user can create the automation workflows, and then, the UiPath Robot executes those tasks. UiPath Robot has two components –

UiPath Agent Service: This service is used to display the available jobs in the system tray. It can also request to start /stop jobs and change settings
UiPath Executor Service: This service
is used to run the given jobs under a Windows session.
Server layer - Once the robot is ready to execute the task, the project can be uploaded on the Orchestrator Server. With the help of Orchestrator, you can run the project on various PCs. The Orchestrator monitors deploys, configures, queue management and logging.

Persistency layer - This layer consists of a database, which takes care of queues and the items in queues. It also consists of information about robot configuration and their assigned processes.
